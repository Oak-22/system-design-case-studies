# Project Abstract

This repository documents a systems-engineering approach to structuring
creative photo editing work as a deterministic, multi-stage pipeline
rather than an ad hoc sequence of manual edits inside a GUI tool.

The project centers on three workflow stages:

1. metadata application, enrichment, and query design
2. baseline conditioning
3. AI mask definition propagation

Together, these stages move repeated work away from unmanaged,
image-by-image execution and toward explicit workflow boundaries,
qualification steps, reusable batch operations, review checkpoints, and
rollback-safe handoffs.

The core engineering claim is not full automation. It is that a large
portion of repeated preparation and correction work can be made more
deterministic, inspectable, and scalable before the final manual editing
pass. Its value is therefore measured less by full automation than by
batchability: which recurring corrections can be safely propagated,
which must be qualified first, and which should remain manual.

The repository supports that argument through stage prose, workflow
image evidence, observed operational results, and runnable
scripts/tests. It should be read as an applied workflow-systems case
study rather than as a packaged application or a controlled benchmark.
