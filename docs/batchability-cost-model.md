# Batchability Cost Model

<br>

## Core Question

For each repeated issue, what is the cost of handling it manually per
image versus converting it to a batchable process?

This document poses that question as the cost model for assessing
pipeline value.

Here, **issue** follows the shared terminology definition: a recurring
workflow need that creates manual effort. See [Issue](terminology.md#issue).

The estimates here are directional rather than benchmarked. They model
how the cost shape changes when a correction operation moves from repeated
manual execution to setup, qualification where needed, batch
application, validation, and targeted exception handling.

## Issue/Correction Model

A single deliverable image can contain many issues or correction requirements
that must be addressed before final review. Some are mandatory only when
a specific condition is present, such as dust, tilted framing, weak
luminance, foliage hue drift, or a semantic region (i.e., sky) that needs local
correction.

The pipeline value comes from separating issue categories by the
automation potential of the correction operation used to address them: which
operations can be batch-applied immediately, which require
qualification first, and which must remain manual even when the same
issue appears many times.

Representative issue and correction categories include:

- **Local defects:** dust/distraction removal, with image-specific Spot Removal kept manual when the target changes per frame
- **Geometry:** straightening and crop decisions
- **Recovery:** AI-assisted recovery for borderline focus/noise cases when the image is otherwise worth keeping
- **Global visual baseline:** luminance and tonal adjustment
- **Scene-level visual baseline:** hue and color normalization within comparable scenes
- **Semantic local edits:** people, foliage, sky, background, foreground, or ground masks
- **Final artistic review:** manual refinement, crop finalization, and subjective delivery choices

## Batchability Matrix

Not every repeated issue can be addressed through batch application. Some
issues recur across a dataset but still require manual image-by-image
judgment because the target region, edit boundary, source pixels, or
aesthetic decision changes with each frame.

The useful distinction is not whether a correction is simply automated or manual, but where it falls on a continuous batchability spectrum.

| Issue / correction need | Pipeline handling | Review burden | Pipeline stage |
|---|---|---|---|
| Identity metadata | Batch-applied through ingest preset | Low | Stage 1 |
| Semantic metadata enrichment | Batch-applied through post-import presets | Low to moderate | Stage 1 |
| Dust/distraction cleanup | Batch-applied after validation | Low to moderate | Stage 2 |
| Tonal normalization | Batch-applied across dataset | Moderate | Stage 2 |
| Scene-level color normalization | Batch-applied within comparable scene groups | Moderate | Stage 2 |
| AI masks for common semantic regions | Qualified, then batch-propagated | Moderate to high | Stage 3 |
| Uncertain semantic regions | Qualified on representative examples before promotion | High | Stage 3 |
| Failed straightening, masking, or normalization cases | Exception handling | High | Stage 2 / Stage 3 |
| Image-specific Spot Removal, blemish, or skin cleanup | Manual per-image correction | High | Manual review |
| Final crop and artistic emphasis | Manual editorial decision | High | Final review |

For example, sensor dust is a strong batch candidate because the defect
can be small, repeated, and safe to remove or omit with limited visual
risk. A large blemish on a primary subject, such as a pimple that
appears across many images, is different. It may be repeated, but the
face position, expression, lighting, skin texture, and healing source
change per frame, so the correction must remain manual. In this tested
workflow, Lightroom did not dynamically remove that recognized entity (skin pimple)
across images with reliable results using either Stage 2 conditioning
techniques or Stage 3 mask propagation techniques.

Once a Stage 3 mask definition has been qualified, propagation across
the [gallery](./terminology.md#gallery) is a batch application in the
same economic sense as Stage 2
cleanup or normalization: the operation is applied at multi-image scale,
then reviewed. The difference is that probabilistic semantic detection
can create a higher exception-review burden because generated masks may
succeed, omit unavailable regions, bind to the wrong region, or produce
boundaries that need manual refinement. Stage 2 automated tonal analysis
can still fail, but its main uncertainty is image-level luminance or
color interpretation; Stage 3 adds semantic-region detection, class
binding, and mask-boundary quality as additional review surfaces.

## Stage-Level Value

### Stage 1: Metadata Application, Enrichment, and Query

Stage 1 shifts metadata work from repeated manual record maintenance to
structured preset application, post-import enrichment, and reusable
query views. The savings come from reducing field-level rework,
avoiding metadata collisions, and making later retrieval faster through
filters and Smart Collections.

The main value is not only faster metadata entry. It is a cleaner state
layer: images become identifiable, queryable, and easier to segment into
working sets before visual editing begins.

### Stage 2: Baseline Conditioning

Stage 2 focuses on correction operations that establish a reliable visual baseline
before creative edits: local cleanup, tonal normalization,
scene-level color normalization, and rollback-safe branching.

The savings come from reducing repeated comparison loops. Instead of
manually trying to match brightness, tone, and color across many images
late in the edit, the workflow establishes a comparable baseline early
and protects it with Virtual Copy branches.

### Stage 3: AI Mask Definition Propagation

Stage 3 focuses on semantic operations whose behavior depends on
probabilistic AI segmentation. The savings come from defining reusable
mask logic once, propagating it across the
[gallery](./terminology.md#gallery), and reviewing
generated results instead of manually brushing each semantic region on
each image.

## How To Demonstrate Savings Clearly

The clearest way to show pipeline value is to separate three different
claims that are easy to blur together if they share one table:

1. **Stage-local savings:** what one stage saves on its own for a
   specific repeated workflow problem.
2. **Observed example run:** what was actually measured in a concrete
   test, with explicit image counts, mask counts, or runtime.
3. **Stacked pipeline effect:** how Stage 1, Stage 2, and Stage 3
   compound by removing different kinds of repeated work across the full
   workflow.

That means this document should treat Stage 3's measured mask
propagation example as a stage-specific proof point, not as a combined
summary for all three stages.

<br>

## Stage-Level Evidence Pattern

When savings are presented, each stage should ideally be described using
the same structure:

| Stage | Repeated manual work being reduced | Batch/pipeline substitute | Evidence type |
|---|---|---|---|
| Stage 1 | Manual metadata entry, re-entry, and retrieval friction | Presets, enrichment, Smart Collection queries | Qualitative workflow reduction |
| Stage 2 | Repeated cleanup, brightness matching, color matching, and rollback recovery | Batch conditioning plus protected branches | Qualitative workflow reduction with operational examples |
| Stage 3 | Manual semantic mask application per region per image | Qualified mask definition propagation plus review | Quantified example run |

This keeps the argument honest: Stage 3 currently has the clearest
back-of-envelope time example, while Stage 1 and Stage 2 are better
described today as cost-shape reductions unless they are later
benchmarked directly.

<br>

## Stage 3 Observed Example

The current Stage 3 example is the strongest quantified proof point in
the project so far because it compares a bounded manual workload against
an observed batch runtime on the same gallery slice.

```text
gallery size: 64 images
qualified masks propagated per image: 9
theoretical maximum mask applications: 64 x 9 = 576

manual model:
576 mask applications x ~10 seconds each = 5,760 seconds = 96 minutes

observed batch runtime:
7 minutes 

directional savings:
96 - 7 = 89 minutes saved
= ~93% less operator time
```

<br>

## Back-of-Envelope Savings Model

The pipeline changes the cost model from repeated per-image execution to
stage setup, qualification where needed, batch application, validation,
and targeted exception handling.

| Workflow area | Manual cost shape | Pipeline-assisted cost shape | Savings driver |
|---|---|---|---|
| Metadata application | Repeated field entry, ad-hoc classification, manual searching | Ingest-time identity preset, post-import semantic enrichment, reusable queries | Fewer field collisions and faster retrieval |
| Baseline conditioning | Repeated cleanup, matching, comparison, and rollback recovery per image | Batch-safe cleanup, dataset/scene-level normalization, protected correction branches | Less comparison burden and safer experimentation |
| AI mask propagation | Manual semantic masking per region per image | Canonical mask definition, batch propagation, human review | Less repetitive masking before review |

<br>

## Directional Formula

For each recurring issue and proposed correction operation, the savings can be
approximated as:

```text
manual_cost = image_count x issue_frequency x average_manual_time_correcting

pipeline_cost =
  setup_time
  + qualification_time
  + batch_execution_time
  + review_time
  + exception_fix_time

estimated_savings = manual_cost - pipeline_cost
```

The pipeline is most valuable when an issue has high frequency,
high manual repetition, and predictable enough behavior to support batch
application after any required qualification. It is less valuable when
the issue is rare, highly subjective, or cheaper to fix manually than to
qualify.

## Summary

Batchability changes where the editor spends attention: less repeated
mechanical editing, more setup, qualification, validation, exception
handling, and final creative review.

Across the three stages, the accumulated value comes from stacking these
stage-local cost-shape changes. Metadata becomes easier to retrieve,
baseline conditioning reduces visual comparison work, and semantic mask
propagation reduces repeated local editing effort. The safest way to
present that cumulative value is to first show each stage's savings on
its own terms, then describe the combined workflow effect second.
