# Case Study: Designing a Baseline Image Normalization Pipeline for Heterogeneous Lighting Conditions

## Executive Summary

High-volume photo datasets captured over long time horizons often contain
significant lighting variance across scenes. This produces inconsistent
visual tone across a gallery even when subject matter is similar.

This case study describes a two-stage normalization pipeline that combines
global luminance normalization with AI-assisted semantic segmentation.

- **Goal:** Establish a consistent visual baseline while preserving natural
  scene variation.
- **Stage 1:** Global luminance normalization (automated tonal analysis).
- **Stage 2:** AI-assisted semantic segmentation for region-specific
  corrections.
- **Outcome:** Precomputed masks reduce editing time and enable predictable
  downstream adjustments.

## Problem

Large photo sets captured across multiple lighting environments introduce
high variance in visual attributes. The pipeline must handle diverse
conditions and scale across datasets without introducing inconsistency.

Example capture conditions include:

- midday direct sunlight
- shaded environments
- late-afternoon or evening lighting

These conditions introduce variance in:

- exposure
- contrast
- color temperature
- vegetation and environmental tones
- skin tone rendering

A naive global editing strategy (e.g., applying identical exposure
adjustments across all images) yields inconsistent results. The same
parameter change interacts differently with each scene.

Example: vegetation color grading becomes difficult when exposure varies
across time-of-day conditions. Foliage shot in shaded evening light may
render a different hue than foliage in strong midday sun. Identical
adjustments therefore produce divergent effects.

The workflow goals are:

- establish a consistent visual baseline across the dataset
- preserve natural scene differences (e.g., time-of-day mood)
- minimize manual editing effort
- avoid repeated global transformations across the editing pipeline

---

## Initial Approach (Multi-Stage Global Presets)

The original workflow attempted multiple preset layers across the dataset:

```text
Import preset
→ secondary editing preset
→ additional correction preset
```

This introduced several issues:

- repeated global edits across the dataset
- increased pipeline complexity
- difficulty maintaining a consistent baseline
- additional manual intervention per image

The pipeline effectively introduced multiple global transformation stages,
increasing the risk of inconsistent results.

---

## Architecture

The pipeline collapses multiple global transformations into a single
deterministic normalization stage followed by localized corrections.

### Pipeline Overview

Stage 1: Global normalization (Auto Tone)
    ↓
Stage 2: AI-based semantic segmentation masks
    ↓
Dataset-wide baseline consistency
    ↓
Stage 3: Selective manual refinement (rare)
```

### Stage 1: Global Normalization

The first stage uses automated tonal analysis to normalize luminance and
contrast. It reduces dataset variance and establishes a common starting
state for all images.

This stage adjusts:

- exposure
- highlights
- shadows
- whites
- blacks
- contrast

This is conceptually similar to feature scaling and histogram
normalization in data pipelines. The goal is not perfect grading per
image but a reduced variance baseline for downstream processing.

### Stage 2: Semantic Segmentation (AI Mask Generation)

After normalization, the pipeline generates automated semantic masks. The
masks identify regions for targeted, region-aware corrections.

Detected regions include:

- facial skin
- body skin
- eye sclera
- hair
- clothing

Key objectives for this stage:

- **Editing acceleration:** Precomputed masks remove per-image masking
  work and speed up localized edits.
- **Localized normalization:** Region-aware masks allow targeted
  corrections without altering unrelated areas.

## Precomputation Strategy

Segmentation masks are created once across the dataset rather than during
editing. This trades upfront processing for much faster downstream edits.

This mirrors engineering patterns such as cached derived attributes,
precomputed embeddings, and secondary indexing. The masks function as
metadata attached to each image and enable fast transformations later.

---

## Controlled Manual Overrides

Manual masking remains available for edge cases but is intentionally
limited. Excessive masking granularity increases cognitive load and
reduces editing speed.

Design rationale:

- overly granular control increases cognitive load
- editing speed decreases with many masks
- most images need minimal localized adjustments after baseline

The workflow prioritizes addressable control rather than complete control.

---

## Resulting Benefits

- consistent visual baseline across heterogeneous lighting conditions
- reduced global editing passes
- faster editing due to segmentation mask precomputation
- reduced manual masking workload
- predictable editing pipeline behavior
- preservation of natural scene tone differences

---

## Engineering Concepts Demonstrated

- baseline dataset normalization
- multi-stage transformation pipelines
- feature segmentation
- precomputed feature generation
- pipeline stage simplification
- batch processing optimization
- controlled override systems
- cognitive complexity management

---

## Key Design Principle

Establish a consistent global baseline first. Apply localized corrections
only where necessary.

---

## Takeaway

This photography workflow becomes a data transformation pipeline design
problem. By separating global normalization from localized corrections and
precomputing segmentation features, the system achieves dataset
consistency and editing efficiency without sacrificing flexibility.
